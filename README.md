# Googley Eyes

<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>
This program tracks the movement of a pair of 'eyes' with JavaScript animation and mouse-movement tracking.

# How to Run
Ensure the following files are on local machine: eyes.html, eyes.css, and png images. Drag and drop eyes.html into the browser to begin the program.

# Future Improvements
One interesting (and perhaps bizarre) feature to add to this program is a click event that temporarily stops the movement of one or both of the eyes.
